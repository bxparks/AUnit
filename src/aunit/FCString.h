/**
 * A union of (const char*) and (const __FlashStringHelper*) with a
 * discriminator. This allows us to treat these 2 strings like a single object.
 * The major reason this class is needed is because the F() cannot be used
 * outside a function, it can only be used inside a function, so we are forced
 * to use normal c-strings instead of F() strings when manually creating Test or
 * TestOnce instances.
 *
 * I deliberately decided not to inherit from Printable. While it is convenient
 * to be able to call Print::print() with an instance of this class, the cost
 * is 2 (AVR) or 4 (Teensy-ARM or ESP8266) extra bytes of static memory for the
 * v-table pointer for each instance. But each instance is only 3 (AVR) or 5
 * (Teensy-ARM or ESP8266) bytes big, so the cost of 50-100 bytes of static
 * memory for a large suite of 25 unit tests does not seem worth the minor
 * convenience.
 *
 * Instead, the print() and println() methods invert the dependency and
 * accept a pointer to 'Print'.
