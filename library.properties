sentence=A unit testing framework for Arduino platforms inspired by ArduinoUnit and Google Test.
paragraph=The unit tests can run on the embedded controller. They can also run on Linux, MacOS, or FreeBSD environments using EpoxyDuino, which allows AUnit to be used in a Continuous Integration environment like GitHub Workflows. AUnit is almost a drop-in replacement of ArduinoUnit with some advantages. AUnit supports timeouts and test fixtures. It somtimes consume 50% less flash memory on the AVR platform, and it has been tested to work on the AVR, STM32, ESP8266, ESP32, Teensy platforms.
